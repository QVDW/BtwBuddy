# Fixed Items Functionality Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Converted FixedItemsManager from Modal to Page
- **Before**: FixedItemsManager was displayed as a popup/modal
- **After**: FixedItemsManager is now a dedicated page/tab in the application

### 2. Updated Navigation
- Added a new tab type `'fixed-items'` to the application state
- Updated the sidebar navigation to include a dedicated "Vaste Items" tab with the Zap icon
- The Zap icon now navigates to the fixed-items page instead of opening a modal

### 3. Updated Home Component
- Removed the `onOpenFixedItems` prop from the Home component
- Updated the "Vaste Items" quick action to navigate to the fixed-items tab instead of opening a modal
- Updated the navigation type to include `'fixed-items'`

### 4. Enhanced FixedItemsManager Component
- Removed modal-specific elements (close button in header)
- Added `onOpenQuickTransaction` prop to handle opening the QuickTransactionForm
- Updated the "Gebruik" (Use) button to open the QuickTransactionForm as a popup
- Improved styling for page layout instead of modal layout

### 5. Updated Styling
- Removed modal-specific padding and styling
- Updated header styling to work better as a page header
- Adjusted content padding to work with the page layout

### 6. Maintained QuickTransactionForm as Modal
- The QuickTransactionForm remains as a popup/modal as requested
- It's triggered by clicking the "Gebruik" button on any fixed item
- This provides the quick transaction functionality while keeping the main management as a page

## User Experience Flow

1. **Access Fixed Items**: Click the Zap icon in the sidebar or use the "Vaste Items" quick action on the home page
2. **Manage Fixed Items**: On the fixed items page, you can add, edit, and delete fixed items
3. **Quick Transaction**: Click "Gebruik" on any fixed item to open the QuickTransactionForm popup
4. **Complete Transaction**: Fill in the quick transaction form and submit to add the transaction

## Technical Implementation

- **App.tsx**: Updated state management, navigation, and component rendering
- **Home.tsx**: Removed modal-specific props and updated navigation
- **FixedItemsManager.tsx**: Converted from modal to page component
- **App.scss**: Updated styling for page layout instead of modal layout

The functionality remains the same, but the user interface is now more intuitive with the fixed items management as a dedicated page rather than a popup.
